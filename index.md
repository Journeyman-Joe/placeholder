## Prototyping use of GitHub pages as an Engineering Notebook

10-MAR-2021
_Why are you starting this writing journey?_

This will be my FIRST Journal, as a Coach and Judge. It will serve as both a personal record, and as a prototype for exploring applications and formats for a team's Engineering Notebook.
Initial section plan will have a reference section, containing documents that are not chronological, and a chronological journal section.

### Reference Documents

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Journeyman-Joe/placeholder/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Journeyman-Joe/placeholder/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
