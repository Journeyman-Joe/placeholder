## Programming Roadmap

This page will help you find your way around the programming resources we use at The Princeton STEM Academy.
It is organized around where you need to go, from where you are at present.

### If You Are Coming From a Lego League Environment

OK; you've programned in EV-3 "Blocks", or "Scratch", but haven't worked with a text-based language, right?
You'll want to learn the _Java_ language, starting with introductory syntax and structures.
There are plenty of online tutorials available.

We are particularly fond of the
[Java (Beginner) Programming Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFE2CE09D83EE3E28)
from _thenewboston_ on YouTube, [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFE2CE09D83EE3E28).
There are 87 videos in this series, but don't panic: they are short,five or ten minutes each, and easy to take, one at a time.
You don't have to do all of them, either: feel free to stop short of the GUI sequence.

We recommend that you **don't** use (or install) the _Eclipse_ IDE mentioned in these videos.
Rather, please install the _Intellij_ IDE, by following the instructions [here](../installing-intellij.md).
_Intellij_ is from _JetBrains_, the same company that provides _Android Studio_, which you'll be using to program the FTC robots.
The transition will be easy if you're moving from _Intellij_ to _Android Studio_, instead of starting with a different IDE.

### What is an IDE?

An IDE is an _Integrated Development Environment_.
These days, most people who program in a modern language use an IDE; it makes things easier.
An IDE contains text editing features for your program files, helpful tools like built-in access to "Help" files,
and features to help you manage individual components of your programming project.

For programming the FTC robots, which use a control system based around the _Android_ operating system, we use the _Android Studio_ IDE.
For learning and teaching _Java_, or for writing and testing code that doesn't need a robot, we use _Intellij_.
If we need to do anything in the _Python_ language, we prefer the _PyCharm_ IDE.

Why do we like that set?  All three are from _JetBrains_, and look very similar from the user viewpoint.
That makes it easy to move from one to another.
All of them can run on Windows, Mac, or Linux computers.
All of them work well with our source code and version control tools, _Git_ and _Github_.
What's not to like?

### If You Know Python from School

_Python_ is an excellent first programming language.
We can't run _Python_ code on the FTC robots (yet) - but it's not a bad choice for testing algorithms,
especially computer vision algorithms.

You might well want to install the _PyCharm_ IDE on your computer to keep your skills sharp.

You'll probably be able to read and understand a lot of _Java_ code, just based on your _Python_ experience.
But you'll want some tutorials, before you start writing code.
We're still going to recommend the [Java (Beginner) Programming Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFE2CE09D83EE3E28)
from _thenewboston_ on YouTube, [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFE2CE09D83EE3E28);
but you'll blast through them faster.
