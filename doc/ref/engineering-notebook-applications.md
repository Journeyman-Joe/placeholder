List of applications for Engineering Notebooks, other purposes, and reviews.

Google Docs - familiar and easy to use.  Provides no structure.

Penzu - OK for personal journaling, I suppose.  Free version has no search, tagging, or indexing features.  I'm not going to try the paid version.  Creating an entry is easy, though, which may matter.  Our immediate problem is daily capture, and that requires a low bar to sit down and write.  My first attempt to insert a Google Drive shared picture file does not seem to have worked.  That's a dealbreaker.  Uploaded picture from my hard drive is OK.

GitHub Wiki - Free account only permits Wikis in a public repository.

GitHub Pages - Free account only permits "Pages" in a public repository.  Created a site in my personal repository, here: https://journeyman-joe.github.io/placeholder/

Trello - Not for Engineering Notebook.  But, hands down, my favorite organizational tool ever.
