## Engineering Notebook Applications

Updated: 16-OCT-2023

List of applications for Engineering Notebooks, other purposes, and reviews.

**Google Docs** - familiar and easy to use.  Provides no structure.

**Penzu** - OK for personal journaling, I suppose.  Free version has no search, tagging, or indexing features.  I'm not going to try the paid version.  Creating an entry is easy, though, which may matter.  Our immediate problem is daily capture, and that requires a low bar to sit down and write.  My first attempt to insert a Google Drive shared picture file does not seem to have worked.  That's a dealbreaker.  Uploaded picture from my hard drive is OK.

**GitHub Wiki** - Free account only permits Wikis in a public repository.

**GitHub Pages** - Free account only permits "Pages" in a public repository.  Created a site in my personal repository, here: https://journeyman-joe.github.io/placeholder/
Presents nicely as a website, but Markdown is still a significant bar to easy content creation.  We need a WYSIWYG interface; this isn't it.  Might be OK for more long-term, durable and static reference information.

**GitHub Pages (updated)** - I've been adding to Placeholder, and have created a few other useful documents editing Markdown directly into the web interface. It's productive - for me. I'm also using an offline Markdown editor, *Ghostwriter*, which seems to work well. I still have to `commit` and `push` my changes to the Placeholder repository manually. I like it, but I don't think it's a good option for Robotics Teams.

**Obsidian** - A fairly new *knowledge base* desktop application. (First released in 2020.) The Markdown editor is easy to use for common features. Files are plain text, in Markdown; very portable. Excellent organizational features incllude hierarchical file structure, linking between notes, and tagging. This application is rapidly gaining popularity. I'm liking it alot, myself.

Downside is that native cloud synchronization is only available with Obsidian's paid "sync" service. Other services will work, but have to be manually integrated. Community plugins might help.

*In this list,* Obsidian *is the category leader for Robotics Team Notebook / Journal applications.*

**Dokuwiki** - A lightweight Wiki platform: "Wikimedia Lite". Locally hosted. Easy to set up on a virtual Debian machine on my network. Pages are in Markdown; there's a built-in easy to use editor that makes learning Markdown unnecessary for basic formatting.

Although editing within a page is easy, creating an organized, linked structure takes some intellectual effort.

Robotics Teams might like it. It *looks* like Wikipedia, which they use every day. Team members would get a feeling that they were contributing to something greater.

**Overleaf** - 

**Google Blog** - 

**Google Sites** - 

**Trello** - Not for Engineering Notebook.  But, hands down, my favorite organizational tool ever.
