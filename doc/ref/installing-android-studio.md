## Installing Android Studio

### What is Android Studio?

**Android Studio** is an *Integrated Development Environment (IDE)* tailored for Android application development in either the Java or Kotlin programming languages.

It is based on the popular *Intellij* IDE from *Jetbrains*. If you use *PyCharm* for Python, or *Intellij* for other Java development, you will have no trouble learning the "ins" and "outs" of *Android Studio*.

### Why should I install it?

You have a choice as a FIRST Tech Challenge programmer. You can program in *Blocks*, which requires nothing more than the web browser already on your computer. You can program in *OnBotJava* (FIRST Tech Challenge's variant of Java) the same way, with a web browser. Or, you can take the time to install and learn Android Studio.

Android Studio has the steepest learning curve, but it's the most powerful and professional option. Android developers all over the world use it. It integrates well with world-class version control and cloud backup solutions, such as Git, and GitHub.

With Android Studio, you'll be able to write code, and even test it somewhat, without your robot. Other programmers on your team will be able to work on different parts of your Robot Controller code at the same time.
