## Installing Android Studio

### What is Android Studio?

**Android Studio** is an *Integrated Development Environment (IDE)* tailored for Android application development in either the Java or Kotlin programming languages.

It is based on the popular *Intellij* IDE from *Jetbrains*. If you use *PyCharm* for Python, or *Intellij* for other Java development, you will have no trouble learning the "ins" and "outs" of Android Studio.

### Why should I install it?

You have a choice as a FIRST Tech Challenge programmer. You can program in *Blocks*, which requires nothing more than the web browser already on your computer. You can program in *OnBotJava* (FIRST Tech Challenge's variant of Java) the same way, with a web browser. Or, you can take the time to install and learn Android Studio.

Android Studio has the steepest learning curve, but it's the most powerful and professional option. Android developers all over the world use it. It integrates well with world-class version control and cloud backup solutions, such as Git, and GitHub.

With Android Studio, you'll be able to write code, and even test it somewhat, without your robot. Other programmers on your team will be able to work on different parts of your Robot Controller code at the same time.

It's the choice of the best FIRST Tech Challenge teams, and of Android developers, everywhere. It's free to download and use.

### Getting and Running the Installer

To download the Android Studio installer, go to the [Developer website](https://developer.android.com/studio), and click the green "Download Android Studio" button. (Don't worry about the version. They use animal names, and march down the alphabet with each new version. The current (Autumn, 2023) version is "Giraffe".) It should automatically offer you the right download (Windows, Mac, Linux) for your platform.

Scroll down the license agreement, check the "I have read and agree" box, and click the "download" button. Your installer download should start automatically. Once it completes, start the installer using whatever procedure works for your platform and web browser.

It's a fairly long download, and a long-running installation process. Try to have a good Internet connection, and, if you're using a laptop, connect your AC adapter.

We recommend that you accept all of the default settings during the installation, and select "Do Not Import Settings" when that option is presented. Dark or light mode is, of course, your choice.

There will be a few places to "Accept" another license agreement during the installation, sometimes more than one on the same popup.
