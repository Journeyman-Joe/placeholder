To clarify what we need the plan view drawing for:  1) It demonstrates that your pieces fit on the raw stock. 2) We can assess whether or not the raw stock has enough physical integrity left to hold together as the cut progresses: both between the product and the edges of the stock, and between multiple products.  3) It provides guidance as to locating the origin on the raw stock. 4) It provides guidance while we're watching the "dry run" (router in the air) - that the path is what we think it is.

@Ashmit Looks good.  I'll point out that the dimensioned drawing suggests that we can move the origin into the clamping zone safely - which wastes less material.  Call that reason number (5).

Even at reduced feed speed, we get a lot of stock vibration with 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) plastic.  The tabs have to be taller, perhaps even full height, in order to work properly.
